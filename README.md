## 🎮 Recommended Playstyle Tips

To get the most out of the script and keep your gameplay looking natural:

- Use **small FOV** and **high smoothness** for the aimbot to avoid robotic snaps.  
- Rely on ESP for **positioning and pre‑aiming**, not just reacting.  
- Mix **head and torso** hitboxes so your accuracy looks like a strong human player, not a machine.  
- Bind a **panic key** to disable everything instantly when needed.  

When tuned correctly, a solid **Sniper Duels Script aim** setup makes your shots feel “too clean to be coincidence” yet not blatantly artificial.

## ❓ FAQ

### ❓ Does Silent Aim and Aimbot work together?

Yes. You can combine both or run them separately.  
A common setup is to use Silent Aim as your baseline assistance and enable Aimbot with low FOV and high smoothness for tougher duels.

***

### ❓ Will this make my aim look obvious?

That depends entirely on your configuration:

- Large FOV + low smoothness = snappy, obvious aim  
- Small FOV + high smoothness = cleaner, human‑like movements  

Spend time tuning your settings to match how you naturally move your mouse or stick.

***

### ❓ What does ESP actually show?

ESP can display:

- Player boxes  
- Names  
- Distance  
- Tracers  

This gives you constant information about enemy positions, rotations, and potential flanks so you never feel “surprised” again.

***

### ❓ Is this safe to run performance‑wise?

The script is written with efficiency in mind:

- Lightweight loops  
- Conditional rendering  
- Optional toggles for heavy visuals  

This helps maintain stable frames even in busy lobbies.

***

### ❓ Can I customize hotkeys?

Yes. Keybinds for:

- Toggling Aimbot  
- Toggling ESP  
- Panic Off  

are all configurable so you can quickly adapt mid‑game or switch styles on the fly.

***

### ❓ Is this a one‑time setup?

You configure it once, save your profile, and then simply load it in future sessions. Different configs can be used for different moods or modes—hyper‑aggressive sessions or chill, “legit” runs.
